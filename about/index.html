    <p> My name is Suman Majumder, a PhD candidate at North Carolina State University. I am working on my PhD under the mentoring of Dr. Brian J. Reich. My research topics focus on spatial or spatiotemporal models and their application to real life problems.</p>

   <p> I did my bachelors and masters degree from Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata (ISI) in India. During my time at ISI, I worked on developing robust statistical methods and their asymptotic properties. </p>

  <p> My research interests include :
  <ul>
  <li> Spatial/Spatiotemporal modeling </li>
  <li> Computational methods for large datasets </li>
  <li> Environmental applications </li>
  <li> Robust statistical methods </li>
   </ul> </p>
