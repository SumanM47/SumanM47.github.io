<p> My name is Suman Majumder, a PhD candidate at North Carolina State University. I am working on my PhD under the mentoring of Dr. Brian J. Reich. My research topics focus on spatial or spatiotemporal models and their application to real life problems.</p>

<p> I did my bachelors and masters degree from Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata (ISI) in India. During my time at ISI, I worked on developing robust statistical methods and their asymptotic properties. </p>

<p> My research interests include :
  - Spatial/Spatiotemporal modeling
  - Computational methods for large datasets
  - Environmental applications
  -Robust statistical methods </p>
